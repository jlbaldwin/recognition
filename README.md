# Employee Recognition Portal

MVC designed CRUD app used to create and manage employee recognition awards. Role-based functionality for Admin and User accounts using PHP session variables. Admins can add/edit/delete user accounts and produce reports. Users can create/delete award classes, create/edit/delete awards, and email award certificates to recipients. 

Built with two team members as a class project, with additional buildout by myself.
